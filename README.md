# Titanic-Learning-From-Disaster

In this project I used a Kaggle dataset that contains data about the Titanic disaster. I used this data to draw conclusions about which demographics of passengers of the ship were most effected by the sinking of the ship. I achieved this by manipulating the data with Python (using the Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, and Matplotlib packages).
